# withCustomMiddleware

Adds a function to the end of the middleware call stack before signature verification. It can be used to override or add additional functionality. Like modifying the user operation, making an additional RPC call, or logging data.

## Usage

::: code-group

```ts [example.ts]
import { provider } from "./provider";

// [!code focus:99]
provider.withCustomMiddleware(CustomMiddlewareOverrideFunction);
```

<<< @/snippets/provider.ts
:::

## Returns

### `ISmartAccountProvider`

An updated instance of the provider, which now uses the custom middleware.

## Parameters

### `override: AccountMiddlewareFn`

The User Operation (UO) transform function that will run as the custom middleware.

## `customMiddleware`

The `customMiddleware` is a readonly field that represents the final middleware step in the stack. It allows overriding any of the results returned by previous middlewares, ensuring customized processing of user operations.

You can access the current middleware configuration for the provider via:

```ts
const currentMiddleware = provider.customMiddleware;
```
